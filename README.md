# FLIGHT PRICE PREDICTION
## Objective:
The main aim of the project is to predict the price of the airline ticket from source to destination using machine learning algorithm.Various algorithms are used,  and the algorithm with best accuracy is deployed.

## Approach:
* Initially the data is gathered and stored in csv format.
* Data is explored using various packages in python like numpy,pandas and scikit learn.
* Visualization is done using libraries matplotlib and seaborn.
* Exploratory data analysis is done to make data clean and be able to feed the data to machine learning algorithm.
* All the categorical data is converted to numerical variables using one hot encoding & label encoding.
* Data is scaled down.
* The scaled data is fed to various machine learning algorithms based on our problem statement.
* Model with best accuracy is taken for better results.
* The model is deployed on cloud platform heroku.
